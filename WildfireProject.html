       <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
       <p>
        In today’s world, we exist in what can be called a “Datapolis,” 
        where our lives are deeply intertwined with data. Traditionally, 
        data is perceived as something inherently digital—a concept that often 
        limits its potential for meaningful engagement. However, this stereotype can be
        challenged by exploring alternative, physical representations of data. Historically, 
        civilizations like the Incas used material objects, such as knot patterns and cord twist directions,
        as sophisticated tools for data storage and communication. Similarly, in the modern context, 
        data should not be confined to abstract graphs and tables. Instead, it can be transformed into physical
        forms that can convey urgency, evoke emotions, and create impactful meanings. Making the
        data more accessible and understandable to a broader audience in the major goal of this project.

            <h1>Define the Problem</h1>
            <p>
                Having lived on the West Coast of the US, my teammate and I have seen the devastating rise in wildfires due to climate change.
                 These fires not only destroy natural landscapes but also pose serious health risks, especially to vulnerable groups
                  like the elderly and children. Despite their impact, wildfire data is often presented in ways that fail to capture 
                  the urgency and emotional toll, making it harder for people to grasp the true scale of the problem.
            </p>
             <br>

            <h1>Goal</h1>
             <p>
            Transform wildfire data into an engaging physical display to make it more accessible and impactful.
             </p>

             <h2>Ideation</h2>
             <br>
             <p>
                 We kicked off the project by conceptualizing a physical artifact to visualize wildfire data using LED lights and acrylic panels,
                 with sketches as early prototypes.

              <h2>Data Selection & Analysis</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                After deciding the project scope, we selected relevant wildfire data (2013-2022) from <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org">Global Forest Watch</a> website in Washington, Oregon, and California, and processed data for display on a comparable scale.

              <h2>Design & Development</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                We created GIF animations to represent different data scales across the three states. The interactive artifact is powered by an Arduino board, 
                LED panels, a sliding bar for controlling the time period, three buttons to control the on/off status of each state, and laser-cut acrylic shaped 
                like the West Coast states. To ensure the lights spread evenly, we also added cotton inside the chamber above the LED panels.

              <h2>Outcome</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                Our physical artifact illuatrate an interactive, visual, and tactile representation of wildfire data, allowing users to explore 
                the impact across different states and time periods.

              <br>
              <p>
                This project taught me the critical role of interactivity and physicalization in data presentation. 
                I learned that transforming data into a tactile and visual experience can enhance user engagement 
                and understanding, making complex information more accessible. Throughout the development process, I also gained 
                valuable experience in troubleshooting technical challenges, particularly in designing the LED displays and coding in 
                an unfamiliar programming language (C++) to make the prototype functional.
