  <h1>Hi👋 Nice to meet you!</h1>
  <p><span class="highlight">My name is Yiwei*</span>. I am a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, studying Information Science with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
  <p>Previously, I studied Public Health and Data Science at the University of Washington, Seattle.</p>
  <p>Coming from an interdisciplinary background, I have a strong interest 
    in bringing technology into the community to create positive social impacts. 
    Aiming to address critical HCI issues, my research focuses on social computing, 
    specifically on topics related to online community, content moderation, and responsible AI. 
    I am also interested in mHealth and general health informatics topics.</p>

  <div class="accordion">My pursuit and future plans…</div>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Coming from an interdisciplinary and international background, I am passionate about exploring the world through multiple perspectives. My interests lie in both the humanities and technical fields. I conduct social research, including field studies, user interviews, and technical writing. At the same time, I also engage in computing, focusing on data science and web/software development. 

      <br>
      <br>

      My research journey started with an undergraduate internship at the New York State Department of Health. In addition to my regular biostatistics tasks, I conducted user research through competitive analysis, accessibility analysis, and heuristic evaluation for a webpage redesign side-project, mentored by a mentor with a human-factors engineering background. Since then, I have found my passion in HCI and its universal connection to various fields, and I enjoy defining problems and solving them to meet people's needs. 
      <br>
      <br>
      
      I am open to opportunities in user research, human-factors engineering, or machine-learning engineering after completing my master’s degree (Fall 2024). I am also interested in pursuing a doctoral degree in relevant fields based on my passion for HCI research.</p>

  <div class="panel">
    <p>I enjoy baking, and I always bake for family and friends during their birthdays and holidays! I believe the process of baking is similar 
      to the process of UX research and design. Both start with ideation and research, then move on to design and prototyping. Imagine you want 
      to bake a cake. You need to think about why and how you want to bake the cake, and what kind of research you need to conduct before you start
       baking (searching for recipes online or through word of mouth, asking if the target audience has any food allergies, etc.). After baking, you 
       can evaluate the recipe by asking how people feel about the taste and texture of the cake and then modify the recipe based on their feedback. 
       Sometimes, you find yourself failing again and again, and you need to figure out which part of the process went wrong.
        (For example, I discovered that a conventional oven generally generates less heat than a stove oven, so if you’re following a recipe from an author using a conventional oven, it’s safer to lower the temperature range if you have a stove oven at home.)</p>

    <p>Besides baking, in my spare time, you will find me strolling/jogging in the woods🏃🏻‍♀️‍➡️,

    <p><b><span style="color: #317bbc;">Recent Update</span></b>: Since I had the chance to explore different online communities during my master's studies, I started contributing on Wikipedia and some Fandom communities as a personal hobby!</p>
