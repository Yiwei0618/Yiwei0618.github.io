    <b>About Nonprofit:</b> <a href="https://rocsolidfoundation.org">Roc Solid Foundation</a> is

   <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
   <p>
    Roc Solid Foundation wants to make sure that these families know that they are not alone. This project will serve as their support system and resource 
    through the ups and downs of their journey. The average treatment cycle of a child fighting cancer is three years, or 1,095 days, so Roc Solid Foundation wants 
    to fill in the parts of the journey that their current programs cannot support: everything in-between. With this initiative, termed the ‚Äú1095 project‚Äù
    (to represent the average number of days kids spend fighting cancer before recovering), we will expand access to support parents by providing a community of families like themselves, vetted resources, and healthcare tools.

    <h1>About the product</h1>
    <p>
      Our client already conducted a series of high-level user interviews such as focus group interviews to inquire users‚Äô basic needs and concerns
    üí¨ Based on the existing materials, we collaborated with our client to conduct more in-depths user research such as the contextual inquiry with client, 
    interviewing child specialist, creation of user journey map, usability test with future users(families with children diagnoses with pediatric cancer)
    ‚úçÔ∏èIn a 4-month time period, we converted our client‚Äôs requirement, user research results, and stakeholders perspective into complete design solutions.
     </p>
     <br>


     <h1>Research Process</h1>
     <br>
     <h2>Expert Interview</h2>
     <p>
      In order to get a better insight on the needs and experience of our target users, 
      we observed the results of a focus group of 10 sets of parents undergoing the struggles 
      of pediatric cancer and conducted an expert interview with a Child Life Specialist at RSF. 
      When undergoing this process from initial diagnosis to treatment, parents may cycle through 
      many different stages of emotion, denial, and fear to try to adjust to the immense changes.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p><b><i>
      ‚ÄúThe vast majority of kids, when they get that diagnosis, say when do I start treatment. 
      Whereas adults are busy saying no this can‚Äôt be happening, this is the worst thing in the world.‚Äù  
      - Bryan, Child Life Specialist

     <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Considering the wide scope of our project area, we conducted a comprehensive competitive evaluation of 
      more than 20 related products, covering aspects such as community involvement, hospital care, treatment provision, 
      and emotional support.
    </p>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/RocSolid/competitive analysis.png"  alt="competitive analysis chart">
    </div>
    <p>
      The glaring pattern that we noticed was that there was no product on the market that offered a central hub for emotional 
      support and tracking that could greatly help patients and their loved ones during the entire timeline, from diagnosis to recovery.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>From Sketch to Lo-Fi Prototype</h2>
    <br>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/RocSolid/sketch.png"  alt="sketch">
    </div>

    <p>
      ‚¨ÜÔ∏è During the "Crazy 8" activity, our sketchbook burst with so many diverse conceptsüí•, 
      each pushing the boundaries of conventional design in an effort to tackle the user needs identified 
      in the initial research phase.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      ‚¨áÔ∏èShifting from quantity to quality, we narrowed down to the following themes: Login Page, Home Page, Community Page,
       Resource Page, Tool page, and Profile Page
    </p>

    <h2>Plan the User Flow and IA</h2>
    <br>

    <div class="photo">

    </div>
    <p>
      Designing an app is much like navigating a game ‚Äì it needs clear rules and a smooth flow to meet user needs effectively. 
      As part of the research team, I was responsible for crafting the user flow and structuring the information architecture. 
      This groundwork was key for our team to advance confidently into the next stage of design.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Usability Test</h2>
    <br>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/RocSolid/Usability Test.png"  alt="Usability Test">
    </div>
    <p>
      Through each iteration of our prototypes, we went through multiple revisions and meetings with Roc Solid Foundation to properly 
      incorporate their feedback into our design process. In order to collect user feedback and identify any opportunities for improvement, 
      we conducted usability testing with 18 users.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Iterations based on usability tests</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Focus on the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô and the ‚Äòhow‚Äô</h2>
    <p>
      7/18 users found the onboarding process lengthy and overly verbose. Additionally, the use of a dark theme with green and black colors 
      obscured the app's identity as a caregiver platform. These users also expressed confusion regarding the app‚Äôs purpose and sought greater 
      transparency about its offerings and the secure handling of user-provided information.

    <h2>Intuitive placement and readability are key</h2>
    <p>
      8/18 users had issues reading or finding information due to a lack of readability.

    <br>

    <br>
    <h2>Unclear icons and wording cause confusion</h2>
    <p>
      8/18 users experienced confusion on various tasks due to unclear icons and wording. 
      Users cited issues such as confusion about the tonal connotation of Resource categories 
      such as ‚ÄúTips and Tricks‚Äù or sensitivity around the idea of sharing "progress‚Äù.

      <h1>My Learning through this role</h1>

      <p>
        <b>üí¨Communication and clarity are the key</b><br>
        During the early phases of the project, we hit some roadblocks due to multiple 
        levels of miscommunication on the timeline and scope of deliverables. Being transparent 
        with the client about feasibility, avoiding technical jargon, working through solutions together,
        and involving them in every step of the design process created a connection a deeper level and helped 
        set clear expectations.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b>ü©µHow to practice empathy on a nuanced level</b><br>
          Working with such an intense subject as pediatric cancer and the diversity of those it affects has helped
           me understand the utmost importance of examining users through an empathetic lens. Seemingly minute details 
           can make all the difference in a user's experience, and it is crucial to approach a contextual situation from all angles.
      </p>
